# Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis and ML Clustering

This project focuses on the segmentation of customers based on their purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and Machine learning clustering algorithms. By leveraging these techniques, the project aims to uncover actionable insights that can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer retention.

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  This step involves exploring the data, cleaning it, and extracting useful statistics about customers, products, and sales.
  
- **RFM Analysis:**  
  Calculation of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer, providing a numerical summary of their interaction with the business. These metrics serve as the foundation for clustering and segmentation.

- **Machine Learning Clustering:**  
  Application of the Machine learning clustering algorithms on the RFM scores to categorize customers into distinct segments. This unsupervised learning approach identifies natural groupings within the data, which can be used for targeted marketing.

- **Product Recommendation System:**
  Developing a recommendation engine to suggest products to customers based on their purchase history.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas/Numpy**: To handle and process data efficiently.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating informative and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: To implement the K-Means clustering algorithm.
